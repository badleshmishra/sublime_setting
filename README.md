## Setup Instructions for --Aura Theme Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the main repository into your **Sublime Text Packages** folder. The location of the Packages folder depends on your operating system:

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<your-username>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text\Packages`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/sublime-text/Packages`

Alternatively, you can also clone the repository directly from Sublime Text:

1. Open **Sublime Text**.
2. Go to **Preferences** > **Browse Packages**.
3. This will open the Sublime Text Packages directory.
4. Clone the repository inside the `Packages` folder using the following command:

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Clone the main repository
git clone https://github.com/badleshmishra/sublime_setting "User"
```
> **Note**: If a folder named `User` already exists in the **Packages** directory, **backup** your existing folder first. Move it to a different location, then clone the repository into the **Packages** folder.

### Step 2: Initialize and Update Submodules

The **Aura Theme Color Scheme** is included in this repository as a submodule. To ensure everything is downloaded properly, initialize and update the submodule:

```bash
cd User
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
### Step 3: Restart Sublime Text

Once the repository and submodules are set up, restart Sublime Text to load the new settings and theme.
> Important: After completing these steps, your Aura Theme Color Scheme will be ready to use! âœ¨
